        <p> This was a logo design the question for which I took from a practicing website named FakeClients. According to the question, I were to make a logo for
an ice-cream shop named Lilliam. It had to be colorful and enticing for the customers. As young children like ice-creams the most, I made the design according to
their tastes.</p>
